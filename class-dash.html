                   <h3>Overview</h3>
                   <p> Primary education is commonly observed for children within their late childhood between ages 6 and 11 plus. 
                       One of the objectives of primary education is to inculcate permanent literacy, numeracy, and ability to communicate
                        effectively. This point has to do with developing the child's speaking, writing, reading and listening skills 
                        and because Primary education is the foremost and basic right of every child, it is the first step in making of 
                        the character of child. The role of primary education is to ensure broad based learning of the child. This includes
                        development of social, cognitive, cultural, emotional and physical skills.
